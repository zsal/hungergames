Hunger Games README

***RESULTS***: https://brilliant.org/competitions/hunger-games/results/
 (my agent was not a survivor but I found the results and other agent code quite insightful)

***NOTE***: haven't reviewed this in a long time but upon a quick glance it appears I totally misunderstood the payoff matrix of this game. By attempting to hunt with slackers I gave myself negative payoff. Instead of hiding this past in shame, I'll keep this as a reminder that teenage Zane (as well as 20s Zane) can make and learn from mistakes.   

Strategy
-------------
 slack with the hunters, hunt with the slackers
 public good freeloader
 non-punishing, non-random
 educated 50 - 50 split that adjusts later based on number of hunters in the game
 thinks that reputation is important so tries its best to maintain it while still surviving


Proof of Concept
-----------------

 mixed strategy nash has probability = .5 for either choice (hunt or slack). My agent sticks to this initially and 
 will slowly adjust to maintain a relatively medium reputation

 public good helps everyone equally regardless of decisions that round, so it has no effect

 reputation is important? I hope so, it really depends on other agent's strategy. But
 those who don't seem like a good 'business' will be missed treated most player's I predict
 except this outlier >:)


Random Thoughts
---------------

 I hope for a lot of agents. This was mainly a learning experience for me.

 May the best man (or woman) win! 

 Thank you to Brilliant.com for hosting this competition!

 Please release feedback, stats for the game, and a ton of other info. I'd like to see how we performed!
